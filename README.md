# **Tourism Sector Development in Indonesian Based on K-means Method**

### **Problem Statement**
Indonesia has a large population and there are various types of tourism. However, Indonesia is one of the countries most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in the tourism sector. Then, by 2021, the number of unemployed in Indonesia reached 8.75 million [1]. It is a challenge for the government to be able to restore and develop the tourism sector in Indonesia.

In 2021, there were approximately 14.3 million workers in the tourism sector [2]. This number increased by approximately 340,000 when compared to 2020 [3]. The government aims to employ 4.4 million people in this sector by 2024. To achieve this target, the government has initiated a program called 'Kita Mulai Sekarang' to develop and promote sustainable tourism [4].

This project will analyze the potential region for the development of the tourism sector. In the analysis, the cluster used K-Means to identify potential region for development in the tourism sector. The project is expected to help in decision-making related to the potential region for development in the tourism sector in Indonesia.
